HTML ZOO WEBSITE 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A simple and engaging zoo website built using HTML and CSS. 
The project showcases basic front-end web development skills, clean layout structure, and responsive styling.

This website is a unfinished project due to  being in the prosses of learning C#.
However this was a learning curve in html and css in neaar future I will come back to continuing this project,
for example: after learning C# I will make it a fully functional with a forms page.
